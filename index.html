      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an endeavoring web developer with a penchant for design.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from the middle of the peach state, Georgia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I can be found poking around bushes and lamposts looking for Geocaches, containers that can be found 
        using GPS coordinates for a game called Geocaching. I love crafting, especially with polymer clay and
        of course...now, coding.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be laid-back and allow creative freedom while I get to create something for others
        to enjoy. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I can now be found in the land of citrus, gators, and merry mice, Orlando, Florida.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Designing has always appealed to me. Anything that can be personalized appeals to me. Perfectionism,
        which I possess, can hold you up in many aspects, but in web development it's advantageous.
